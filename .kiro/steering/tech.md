# Technology Stack

## Core Technologies

- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript for type safety and enterprise reliability
- **API Framework**: Express.js with middleware for CORS, rate limiting, and validation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for audit trails and structured data, Redis for caching
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with enterprise SSO integration
- **NLP Processing**: spaCy or similar for entity extraction and text analysis
- **Document Processing**: Libraries for PDF, DOCX, TXT, and JSON parsing
- **Machine Learning**: Python-based ML pipeline for continuous learning
- **Containerization**: Docker with Kubernetes for scaling and deployment

## Architecture Pattern

- **Microservices**: Modular services for API gateway, verification engine, domain modules
- **Event-driven**: Async processing pipeline with proper error handling
- **RESTful APIs**: Standard HTTP endpoints with comprehensive error responses
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for performance optimization and result caching

## Common Commands

### Development

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev         # Start development server with hot reload
npm run build       # Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
npm test            # Run unit and integration tests
npm run lint        # Run ESLint for code quality
```

### Testing

```bash
npm run test:unit      # Run unit tests only
npm run test:integration # Run integration tests
npm run test:e2e       # Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:coverage  # Generate test coverage report
```

### Deployment

```bash
docker build -t certaintyai .     # Build Docker image
docker-compose up -d              # Start services locally
kubectl apply -f k8s/             # Deploy to Kubernetes
npm run deploy:staging            # Deploy to staging environment
npm run deploy:prod               # Deploy to production
```

## Performance Requirements

- Response time: < 2 seconds per document
- Throughput: 10,000+ documents/hour
- Uptime: 99.9% availability
- Scaling: Auto-scaling based on load
