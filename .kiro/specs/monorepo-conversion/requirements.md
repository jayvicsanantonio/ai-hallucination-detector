# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves converting the existing CertaintyAI codebase into a monorepo structure and building a separate frontend application that consumes the existing API endpoints. The monorepo will organize the backend API and new frontend application as separate packages while maintaining shared dependencies and build processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase organized as a monorepo, so that I can manage both backend and frontend applications in a single repository with shared tooling and dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the monorepo structure is implemented THEN the system SHALL organize code into separate packages under a `packages/` directory
2. WHEN the monorepo is configured THEN the system SHALL use a workspace manager (npm workspaces or Lerna) to manage dependencies
3. WHEN building the monorepo THEN the system SHALL support building both packages independently and together
4. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL hoist common dependencies to the root level while maintaining package-specific dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a React-based web application, so that I can provide a user interface for the CertaintyAI verification system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend application is created THEN the system SHALL use React with TypeScript for type safety
2. WHEN the frontend is built THEN the system SHALL include modern tooling (Vite, ESLint, Prettier)
3. WHEN the frontend starts THEN the system SHALL run on a different port than the backend API
4. WHEN the frontend is deployed THEN the system SHALL be production-ready with optimized builds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a web interface to upload documents and view verification results, so that I can interact with the CertaintyAI system through a browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the frontend THEN the system SHALL provide a document upload interface
2. WHEN uploading a document THEN the system SHALL display verification progress and results
3. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL show confidence scores with color-coded risk indicators
4. WHEN reviewing results THEN the system SHALL display detailed verification findings and audit information
5. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the frontend to consume existing API endpoints, so that I can leverage the current backend infrastructure without modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN the system SHALL use the existing REST endpoints (/verify, /results, /feedback)
2. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL support JWT-based authentication from the existing API
3. WHEN making requests THEN the system SHALL handle CORS configuration properly
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages based on API responses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared configuration and tooling across packages, so that I can maintain consistency and reduce duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the monorepo THEN the system SHALL share TypeScript configuration across packages
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL support running tests for individual packages or all packages
3. WHEN linting code THEN the system SHALL use consistent ESLint rules across all packages
4. WHEN formatting code THEN the system SHALL use shared Prettier configuration
5. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL support building all packages with a single command

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want updated deployment configurations, so that I can deploy both backend and frontend applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL provide separate Docker configurations for backend and frontend
2. WHEN using Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL include updated deployment manifests for both applications
3. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL provide docker-compose configuration for the full stack
4. WHEN building CI/CD pipelines THEN the system SHALL support building and testing both packages
