# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CertaintyAI is an AI Hallucination Detector designed to protect enterprise organizations from costly AI-generated errors. The system embeds directly into existing workflows to catch factual errors, logical inconsistencies, and compliance violations before they reach clients or regulators. It acts as an always-on verification layer that provides confidence scores, flags risky outputs, and maintains complete audit trails for every AI-generated document or recommendation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time AI Output Verification

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want real-time verification of AI-generated content, so that I can prevent factual errors and compliance violations from reaching clients or regulators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI system generates content THEN HallGuard SHALL analyze the output within 2 seconds
2. WHEN factual errors are detected THEN the system SHALL flag the content with specific error locations
3. WHEN logical inconsistencies are found THEN the system SHALL provide detailed explanations of the inconsistencies
4. WHEN compliance violations are identified THEN the system SHALL reference specific regulatory requirements that are violated
5. IF the content passes all verification checks THEN the system SHALL provide a confidence score between 0-100

### Requirement 2: Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As an IT administrator, I want seamless integration with existing enterprise workflows, so that teams can use CertaintyAI without disrupting current processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with existing systems THEN HallGuard SHALL provide REST APIs for all major functions
2. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL support common enterprise formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, JSON)
3. WHEN integrated via API THEN the system SHALL respond within the existing workflow timeout limits
4. IF integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and fallback options
5. WHEN deployed THEN implementation SHALL be completed within 5 business days

### Requirement 3: Audit Trail and Compliance Tracking

**User Story:** As a risk management officer, I want complete audit trails of all AI verification activities, so that I can demonstrate compliance and track system performance for regulatory purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is processed THEN the system SHALL log all verification activities with timestamps
2. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL record the specific error types and confidence levels
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide exportable audit logs in standard formats
4. IF regulatory inquiry occurs THEN the system SHALL provide complete verification history for any document
5. WHEN storing audit data THEN the system SHALL retain logs for minimum 7 years per compliance requirements

### Requirement 4: Domain-Specific Learning and Adaptation

**User Story:** As a department head, I want the system to learn from our specific domain and improve accuracy over time, so that verification becomes more precise for our industry-specific content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing domain-specific content THEN the system SHALL adapt verification rules based on historical patterns
2. WHEN false positives occur THEN users SHALL be able to provide feedback to improve future accuracy
3. WHEN new compliance rules are added THEN the system SHALL incorporate them into verification logic within 24 hours
4. IF domain expertise is lacking THEN the system SHALL request human expert validation for edge cases
5. WHEN learning from feedback THEN the system SHALL improve accuracy by at least 5% per month

### Requirement 5: Multi-Industry Support

**User Story:** As a sales executive, I want to deploy CertaintyAI across different high-risk industries, so that we can serve legal, financial, healthcare, and insurance sectors with industry-specific verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving legal teams THEN the system SHALL verify contract accuracy and legal compliance requirements
2. WHEN processing financial documents THEN the system SHALL validate numerical accuracy and regulatory compliance
3. WHEN handling healthcare content THEN the system SHALL check medical accuracy and HIPAA compliance
4. WHEN reviewing insurance claims THEN the system SHALL verify policy compliance and fraud indicators
5. IF industry-specific rules conflict THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most restrictive compliance requirements

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want CertaintyAI to handle enterprise-scale document volumes efficiently, so that verification doesn't become a bottleneck in our workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing high volumes THEN the system SHALL handle at least 10,000 documents per hour
2. WHEN system load increases THEN response times SHALL not exceed 5 seconds for any single document
3. WHEN scaling up THEN the system SHALL automatically provision additional resources as needed
4. IF system capacity is reached THEN the system SHALL queue requests and provide estimated processing times
5. WHEN under peak load THEN system availability SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime

### Requirement 7: User Interface and Reporting

**User Story:** As an end user, I want intuitive dashboards and clear reporting, so that I can quickly understand verification results and take appropriate actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL display confidence scores with color-coded risk indicators
2. WHEN errors are found THEN the system SHALL highlight specific text sections with explanatory tooltips
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide executive summaries with key metrics
4. IF trends are detected THEN the system SHALL alert users to patterns in error types or frequency
5. WHEN accessing historical data THEN users SHALL be able to filter and search verification results by date, type, and department
